# BU Arts Passport

## Description
BU Arts Passport is a simple and lightweight app that tracks student engagement in arts events hosted by the BU Arts department. 
This project aims to streamline the process of attending art events at school: starting from seeing the ongoing and upcoming events, 
finding out the details of interested events, to finally checking in and tracking the participation to these events.
